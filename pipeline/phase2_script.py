Use the following hook concept as your core theme: "{hook_formatted}" (short hook: "{topic.get('short_hook', '')}").

Narration Style Requirements:
1. Pacing & Punchiness: 5 to 15 words per segment's narration. CRITICAL: NEVER split a single sentence across multiple segments! Each segment MUST contain 1 or 2 complete, self-contained sentences. If you split a sentence, the voiceover will pause awkwardly mid-sentence.
2. Conversational & Extreme Simplicity: Use ONLY 5th-grade vocabulary. Extremely simple words, no complex grammar, no SAT words. Must be so simple a 10-year-old understands instantly.
3. Engaging Tone: The voiceover narration must be conversational, highly engaging, and relatable—like a friend telling an exciting story. Write the voiceover to be energetic, warm, and inviting.
3. Hook/Pattern Interrupt: Segment 1 must immediately shatter attention. Start with a shocking visual or conceptual paradox in under 12 words.
4. Emotional/Sensory Triggers: Use strong, dramatic verbs and adjectives (e.g., "panicking", "shatters", "banned", "impossible", "bankrupt", "secret", "trapped").
5. No Fluff: Get straight to the mind-blowing business fact or historical event. Every word must justify its existence.

For every `broll_query` field, write a SHORT, SPECIFIC, STOCK-FOOTAGE-FRIENDLY
search term of 3-6 words MAXIMUM. Write exactly what a human would type into
a stock video search bar (Pexels, Pixabay, etc). Use concrete nouns and visual
objects — NOT instructions or descriptions of what you want.

CORRECT examples: "Steve Jobs presenting iphone", "Wall street stock market ticker",
"abandoned factory ruins", "corporate skyscraper boardroom", "vintage 1950s television",
"money printing machine", "retail store empty shelves", "business handshake contract"

WRONG examples: "visually jarring close-up of the topic", "macro b-roll of historical
event", "closing beautiful shot returning to start", "diagram concept visualization",
"complex financial derivative graph" (too specific for stock footage), "product" (too ambiguous, returns generic boxes)

IMPORTANT B-ROLL RULES:
- Stock video sites DO NOT HAVE highly specific obscure startup founders or old unknown brands by name.
- For abstract business concepts, use terms like "stock market trading screen", "business meeting argument", "vintage newspaper headline", or "empty office building".
- NEVER use the word "product" alone, as stock sites return generic blank boxes. Use "shopping mall busy" or "vintage advertisement poster".

For each segment, also provide a `broll_queries` array with 3-5 ALTERNATIVE search terms for the same visual concept. These should be synonyms, related concepts, or different angles on the same subject. The first entry should match `broll_query`.

For any named person (scientist, historical figure): ALWAYS include their name in the query.
For abstract science concepts: use the most recognizable visual symbol.

For Segment 1 specifically:
- `broll_query` MUST describe a high-motion, high-contrast, visually arresting shot (fast motion, bright colors, dramatic close-up) — this is the opening pattern-interrupt that determines whether viewers keep watching.

For Segments 2 to (n-1):
- Frame facts with visual or historical paradoxes (e.g., 'A company worth billions that didn't sell a single product' or 'The worst ad in history that made them millionaires').
- Deliver the single most mind-bending historical fact in Segment 2.
- Introduce an open loop (a second mystery or surprise fact) in Segment 3 that builds tension towards the loop twist.

For the final segment (Segment {segment_count}) specifically:
- MUST be a 1-sentence Call-to-Action that matches the video's emotional tone and drives viewers to check the link in description/bio.
- MUST literally include the exact phrase "link in bio" or "link in the description".
- Good examples: "For more mind-blowing details, check the link in bio.", "The full breakdown is waiting at the link in bio.", "Ready for the deep dive? Check the link in description."
- NEVER write a generic CTA like "Dive deeper!" or "Want to learn more?" without explicitly mentioning the link.
- Relaxed word limit: Up to 15 words to allow natural integration of the link phrase.
- MUST resolve all loops and end on a transition that flows seamlessly back into Segment 1's hook narration.
- The final sentence should THEMATICALLY echo or re-contextualize the IDEA from Segment 1's hook.

Narration Style Requirements:

2. Engaging Tone: The voiceover narration must be conversational, highly engaging, and relatable—like a friend telling an exciting story. Write the voiceover to be energetic, warm, and inviting.

- Act 1: The core mystery/mechanism (segments 3-7)
