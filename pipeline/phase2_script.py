Narration Style Requirements (with CH1 EduFun Niche Quality Signals):
1. Pacing & Punchiness: 5 to 15 words per segment's narration. CRITICAL: NEVER split a single sentence across multiple segments! Each segment MUST contain 1 or 2 complete, self-contained sentences. If you split a sentence, the voiceover will pause awkwardly mid-sentence.
2. Conversational & Extreme Simplicity: Use ONLY 5th-grade vocabulary. Extremely simple words, no complex grammar, no SAT words. Must be so simple a 10-year-old understands instantly.
3. Engaging Tone: The voiceover narration must be conversational, highly engaging, and relatable—like a friend telling an exciting story. Write the voiceover to be energetic, warm, and inviting.
3. Hook/Pattern Interrupt: Segment 1 must immediately shatter attention. Start with a shocking visual or conceptual paradox in under 12 words.
4. Emotional/Sensory Triggers: Use strong, dramatic verbs and adjectives (e.g., "panicking", "shatters", "banned", "impossible", "melts", "secret", "trapped").
5. No Fluff: Get straight to the mind-blowing science. Every word must justify its existence.

COMPANION LAYER - NICHE & FORMAT UPGRADE (SHORT):
- FORMAT RULE (20-30s Shorts): The entire video IS the hook. Hook, content, and payoff happen simultaneously.
  * Grab (0-3s): One powerful statement, visual, or question. No intro. No channel name. No fluff.
  * Deliver (3-20s): The actual value/story/reveal. Fast. Dense. No filler.
  * Payoff + CTA (20-30s): The punchline, answer, result, or twist (one line only), then end.
  * Avoid: Words that do not carry weight, silence over 1s, padding, slow pacing.
- NICHE QUALITY SIGNALS (Education):
  * SHOW THE RESULT FIRST: State or show the answer/outcome before explaining how you get there. Viewers stay to understand something they just saw — not to wait.
  * B-ROLL THAT PROVES THE POINT: Every concept explained verbally must have a visual that demonstrates it, not just decorates it.
  * ONE CLEAR GAIN PER VIDEO: Teach exactly one thing. Script must answer: "What is the single thing this viewer will walk away with?"
  * TEXT OVERLAYS THAT REINFORCE, NOT REPEAT: Use text for key terms, surprising numbers, simple diagrams, or summary sentences. Do not transcribe verbatim.
  * CONTINUOUS CURIOSITY LOOP: Every 2-3 segments, give a new reason to stay with a new question (e.g., "But here's where it gets interesting...").

For every `broll_query` field, write a SHORT, SPECIFIC, STOCK-FOOTAGE-FRIENDLY
search term of 1-3 CONCRETE PHYSICAL NOUNS MAXIMUM (e.g., "water pipes", "ancient scroll", "mummy coffin", "sea sponges", "gold jewelry").
Write exactly what a human would type into a stock video search bar. Use concrete nouns and visual objects — NOT instructions, verbs, or descriptions of what you want.

CRITICAL BROLL QUERY RULES:
- EVERY segment's broll_query MUST directly represent the exact physical subject mentioned in THAT SPECIFIC segment's narration line! (e.g., if narration mentions Pluto or Charon, broll_query MUST be "Pluto moon", "spinning planet", or "mountain range aerial"). NEVER output unrelated terms like "black hole" unless the narration explicitly mentions black holes!
- MUST be 1-3 simple, concrete physical nouns (e.g. "water pipes", "ancient scroll", "mummy coffin", "sea sponges", "gold jewelry", "smartphone", "mountain peaks aerial").
- NEVER include abstract adjectives, verbs, or meta-words like "animated", "defect", "dramatic", "unraveling", "stuck", "shattered", "cross section", "concept", "visualization", "illustration".
- Write queries that represent real physical footage found in stock video libraries or YouTube documentaries.

CORRECT examples: "Stephen Hawking wheelchair", "DNA double helix",
"quantum computer chip", "black hole space", "astronaut spacewalk",
"brain neurons firing", "atom particle collider", "coral reef fish"

WRONG examples: "visually jarring close-up of the topic", "macro b-roll of scientific
element", "closing beautiful shot returning to start", "diagram concept visualization",
"animated gate valve defect", "ancient scroll unraveling dramatic", "cross section stuck"

IMPORTANT B-ROLL RULES:
- Stock video sites DO NOT HAVE specific molecules or rare deep-sea fish by name.
- For chemicals or proteins, use terms like "abstract science background", "microscope biology animation", "glowing particles", or "fluid dynamics".
- NEVER use the word "chemical" alone, as stock sites return industrial factories and smokestacks instead of biology. Use "chemistry laboratory" or "liquid mixture".

For each segment, also provide a `broll_queries` array with 3-5 ALTERNATIVE search terms for the same visual concept. These should be synonyms, related concepts, or different angles on the same subject. The first entry should match `broll_query`.

For any named person (scientist, historical figure): ALWAYS include their name in the query.
For abstract science concepts: use the most recognizable visual symbol.

For Segment 1 specifically:
- `broll_query` MUST describe a high-motion, high-contrast, visually arresting shot (fast motion, bright colors, dramatic close-up) — this is the opening pattern-interrupt that determines whether viewers keep watching.

For Segments 2 to (n-1):
- Frame facts with visual or scientific paradoxes (e.g., 'Something the size of a city that weighs more than the sun' or 'The man who failed entrance exams rewrote the universe').
- Deliver the single most mind-bending scientific fact in Segment 2.
- Introduce an open loop (a second mystery or surprise fact) in Segment 3 that builds tension towards the loop twist.

For the final segment (Segment {segment_count}) specifically:
- MUST be a 1-sentence Call-to-Action that matches the video's emotional tone and drives viewers to check the link in description/bio.
- MUST literally include the exact phrase "link in bio" or "link in the description".
- Good examples: "For more mind-blowing details, check the link in bio.", "The full breakdown is waiting at the link in bio.", "Ready for the deep dive? Check the link in description."
- NEVER write a generic CTA like "Dive deeper!" or "Want to learn more?" without explicitly mentioning the link.
- Relaxed word limit: Up to 15 words to allow natural integration of the link phrase.
- MUST resolve all loops and end on a transition that flows seamlessly back into Segment 1's hook narration.
- The final sentence should THEMATICALLY echo or re-contextualize the IDEA from Segment 1's hook.

The script must have 15 to 18 segments, each targeting 25-35 seconds of narration.

Narration Style Requirements (with CH1 EduFun Niche Quality Signals):
1. Conversational & Simple Language: Use very simple, easy-to-understand, and highly relatable words that anyone can easily follow. Avoid obscure, complex, or overly difficult English vocabulary. Keep the narration friendly, extremely engaging, and relatable—like a friend explaining an amazing topic.
2. Engaging Tone: The voiceover narration must be conversational, highly engaging, and relatable—like a friend telling an exciting story. Write the voiceover to be energetic, warm, and inviting.

- Intro hook (segments 1-2)
- Act 1: The core mystery/mechanism (segments 3-7)
- Act 2: The surprising twist/implication (segments 8-12)

COMPANION LAYER - NICHE & FORMAT UPGRADE (LONG):

  * Hook (0:00-0:20, segments 1-2): Most powerful moment first. No intro, no fluff.
  * Context (0:20-0:45, segment 3): Minimum context needed. Nothing more.
  * Core content (0:45-4:00, segments 4-13): Max 2-3 main points. Each point needs: a clear statement, one visual/example that proves it, and transition.
  * Surprising Part (4:00-5:00, segments 14-16): Save one strong, interesting thing for here to prevent retention collapse.
  * Payoff + CTA (5:00-5:30, segments 17-18): Wrap core idea. One line CTA. End clean.
- PATTERN INTERRUPT: Include exactly 2-3 pattern interrupts total (visual shift, tonal change, new angle) around 1:30, 3:00, and 4:30.
- Avoid: intro/context >45s, padding middle, saving best point for end, or >3 main points.
- NICHE QUALITY SIGNALS (Education):
  * SHOW THE RESULT FIRST: State or show the answer/outcome before explaining how you get there. Viewers stay to understand something they just saw — not to wait.
