Sub-cluster focus for this batch: {current_subcluster}

CRITICAL: Do NOT suggest any topic similar to these recently published topics:
{json.dumps(recent_topics, indent=2)}

SAFETY & COMPLIANCE CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY):
- The topics MUST be 100% advertiser-friendly, family-friendly, and compliant with YouTube/Meta community guidelines.
- Strictly AVOID: medical advice, health/cure claims, Covid-19/vaccine/epidemic speculation, dangerous stunts/activities, illegal substances, or weapons.
- Avoid political controversies, conspiracy theories, or tragic/graphic events.
- Focus on educational, curious, and inspiring business and economic history.

AVOID: Nature, marine biology, space, engineering, pure science.
FOCUS: Business, economic history, advertising, corporate collapses, startups, product failures, and monopolies.

Return ONLY a raw JSON array of objects. No markdown, no preamble.
Each object must have exactly these fields:
- "topic": specific subject with a named fact, theory, or mechanism (e.g. "Quantum entanglement enables faster than light simulation without moving particles")
- "short_hook": opening question or statement, 8 words or less, creates a strong information gap
- "hook_type": one of "curiosity_gap", "contrarian", "time_pressure", "self_identification", "narrative_pull"
- "for_format": "short", "long", or "both"
- "subcluster": the sub-cluster this belongs to (string)
